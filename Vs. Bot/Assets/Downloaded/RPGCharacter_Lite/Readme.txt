RPG Character Lite
Lylek Games

Thank you for downloading this asset!

I hope this assets helps you get a feel for what all is included in the full package:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/rpg-character-creation-full-pack-81757

You can find the provided character in the Prefabs folder.

This character was created using the full version of the package. Originally the character consisted of eight separate,
interchangeable, skinned meshes, and seven different materials. With two clicks of the combine script (provided in the
full package) we turned the character into a single mesh, with only one material! As you may see, none of the original
meshes, materials, or textures need required in th package after they're combined. The new mesh data can be seen in the
sub folders of the Prefabs folder.

I hope you enjoy your free optimized RPG Character! =)
Basic controls, move animations, and emotes included as well!

We do our best to make our assets as user-friendly as possible! Please, by all means, do not hesitate
to send us an email if you have any questions or comments!

PLEASE LEAVE A RATING AND REVIEW! =)
***Even a small review may help immensely with prioritizing updates!***
Assets with few and infrequent reviews/ratings tend to have less of a priority and my be late or miss-out on crucial compatibility updates, or even be depricated!
Thank you!
